            Hey there! I am <strong>Puneet</strong>. 
            <br>I am an experienced Machine Learning Engineer with a Master's degree in Computer Science and over nine years of experience. I have a strong foundation in languages such as Python, Java, Perl, C/C++, C#, Matlab, bash, and javascript, as well as working knowledge of frameworks like Pyspark, Flask, Apache (Hadoop, Pig), Couchbase, AWS, and Keras. Throughout my career, I have optimized pricing, developed speaker identification systems, extracted company names and key-people from websites, and identified duplicate documents in real-time. I am also passionate about working on personal projects that allow me to continuously improve my skills and expand my knowledge base.<br>
            You can reach me via email: <strong>pludu@buffalo.edu</strong>. Iâ€™m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
